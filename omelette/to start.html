    so hi
    in this page I'm going to help you understand the project more sooooo -let's start- </pre>
    <hr>
    <h1>where to start</h1>
    <pre>once you enter the folder named "omelette" you should've have found this page and a folder named "challenge"
        so ,once you get in that folder you're supposed to find to other folders wich are
        <p>
            -codes: where you're gonna find the html and css of the page
            -images: that contains the images you'll need in this challenge and a video of the page (I don't know how to get an image showing the whole page at a time)
        </p>
        so to start you're gonna have to get a vision of the task you got right?
        well you've got that video and these two css and html docs so you can either:
        <p>
            -do the challenge according to the video
            or
            -upload the whole challenge file then open the page in your browser ---I advise that choice--- 
        </p>

        <h1>Finally...</h1>
        if you got any problem you can inspect the page that you get from the "codes folder" or even see the code but please don't forget that it's not the only solution and that the important is that your result looks as close to the page as possible
        for me as an intermediate, this page took me about 2h30min, but i think it doesn't take that much.
        if you needed anything or got any question concernning this challenge, please don't esitate to text me
        <hr>
        <h1>Good work!</h1>
    </pre>
